# angular-express-twitch-tipping-service

## Description

This app is here to help with writing an application that mocks a tipping service using some of
twitch's api.

## Installation

* `npm i`

## Development
* Linux: `MONGO_URI=<your mongo uri> npm start`, Windows: `set MONGO_URI=<your mongo uri> && npm start`

## Prod - If one ever feel the need to actually see this as more than a demo
* Well, the obvious things would be using the real twitch tipping service, also styling the application.
* Remove any usages of the dummy twitch account I opened. see `authentication/index.js` and `app/core/get-twitch-client-id.js`
